#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering - is a systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the development, opration and maintanance of asoftware.
importance include:
1. user experience - software engineering ensuresthat applications meet user expactations leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.
2. Innovation - software engineering provides the foundation for developing new technologies and applications.
3. Adaptability - software engineering enables organisations to adapt to new technology, frameworks and methodologies ensuring that their software remains relevant and competetive.
4. Quality assuarance - softwarwe engineering practices help ensure that software is reliable and meets quality standards.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering machine - The first compilers were defined; operating systems were noninteractive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging.
2. Mastering process -  Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation,
3. Mastering Complexity - The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification. The use of structured family and data modeling methodologies was extended. However, data modeling (database) and function modeling (structured methods) still followed separate paths. These two modeling paths converged in object-oriented methods like early on in structured methodologies, they were first introduced in coding and design, and finally in specification and analysis.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
2. requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
3. design - building the framework. 
4. coding - converting software design into tangible code.
5. testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
     1.WATERFALL METHODOLOGY 
- Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
scenario of use: 
1. Regulated Industries: Projects in industries like healthcare or finance, where compliance and documentation are critical, benefit from the structured nature of Waterfall.
2. Small Projects with Clear Requirements: If the project scope is well-defined and unlikely to change, Waterfall can be efficient.
     2.AGILE METHODOLOGY
- Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
scenario of use:
1. Dynamic and Evolving Projects: Projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, such as startups or innovative products, benefit from Agile's flexibility.
2. Complex Projects with Uncertain Requirements: When the project scope is not well-defined, Agile allows teams to adapt as they learn more about user needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer 
- developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software
2. Quality Assurance Engineer
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
3. Project Manager
  - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
   importance:
 - An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
- An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand.
 2. Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
- Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
- Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
- Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 

2. Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

3. Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

4. Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution:
research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

5.Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution:
Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. UNIT TESTS - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
2. INTEGRATION TESTS - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
3. SYSTEM TESTING -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
4. ACCEPTANCE TESTS - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
1. Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
2. Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
3. developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about the project."

Improved Prompt:
"Please provide a summary of the marketing project you completed last quarter, including the objectives, key strategies used, and the results achieved."

Explanation of Improvement
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies that the response should focus on a particular project (the marketing project) and a specific timeframe (last quarter). This eliminates ambiguity about which project is being referred to.

Specificity: The improved prompt outlines exactly what information is needed: a summary, objectives, key strategies, and results. This helps the respondent understand what aspects of the project to focus on, ensuring that the response is comprehensive and relevant.

Conciseness: The improved prompt is still concise while providing enough detail to guide the response. It avoids unnecessary complexity and keeps the request straightforward.

Actionable: The improved prompt gives clear instructions on what to include in the response, making it easier for the respondent to provide the desired information without having to guess what is expected.

Effectiveness of the Improved Prompt
The improved prompt is more effective because it reduces ambiguity and provides clear guidance on what is required. This leads to more focused and relevant responses, saving time for both the requester and the respondent. In contrast, the vague prompt could result in a wide range of interpretations, leading to responses that may not meet the requester's needs. By being clear, specific, and concise, the improved prompt enhances communication and increases the likelihood of receiving useful information.
